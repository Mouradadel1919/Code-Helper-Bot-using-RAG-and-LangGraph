# Code Helper Bot using RAG and LangGraph

This project implements a code assistant bot capable of generating and explaining code using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture integrated with LangGraph. The system combines embeddings, vector search, and a powerful language model to deliver accurate and context-aware code assistance.

## Overview

The application supports the following capabilities:

- **Code Generation and Explanation**: Users can input code or questions to receive generated code snippets or detailed explanations.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Relevant context is retrieved from a vector store to guide the modelâ€™s output.
- **LangGraph-Based Architecture**: Workflow orchestration and decision-making are handled through LangGraph.
- **Embeddings**: Utilizes the `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` model to embed user queries and documents.
- **Vector Store**: Employs ChromaDB to store and retrieve semantically similar queries and responses.
- **Language Model**: Uses `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct` for high-quality code generation and explanation.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance was assessed using a subset of 10 examples from the MBPP dataset, achieving 80% accuracy while maintaining efficient GPU usage and fast inference time.
- **Deployment**: The application is deployed using Gradio's ChatBotInterface for interactive usage.
